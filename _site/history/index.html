<p>Brass:</p>

<p>Keyboards:</p>
<p>The beginning of the keyboard started in 3rd century BC when it was introduced organ in Alexandria, Egypt. The organ was the first keyboard instrument and it produced with different keys to harmonize different sounds created by Ctesibius. He created a very small organ, stand of the keyboard, and short amount keys to play with. Then in 1361, the cathedral organ at Halberstadt, Germany built a bigger organ with three chromatic keyboards, three pedals, and keys made wider. Then in the 16th century, the organ began more cultivating to make more songs with Renaissance performing, though most of the people didn’t know the difference of keys of organ instruments. There are multiple types of the organ from around the world that symbolize the sounds and style instruments, and some of them believed that it is hard to recognize the meaning of echoes</p>

<p>Then in 1500, Italy created harpsichord to create a new keyboard instrument, then it started to expand to become more important from around Europe. Then in the middle of the 17th Century, Bartolomeo Cristofori made the first invention of the piano, it was a successful keyboard instrument invention and became the known most important to play in any music genre. Then in 1711, the piano instrument was described in different symbols, for instance, Scipione Maffei called Bartolomeo’s piano invention “gravicembalo col piano e forte” - “harpsichord with soft and loud”.</p>

<p>In the 1730s, Gottfried Silbermann of Freiberg was a builder or organ, harpsichord, and clavichords. Clavichord expanded more and it is almost related to harpsichord that is almost look alike, though the sounds are highly different, like clavichord sound sharp, less high notes, and early close sound after it played, and in harpsichord sound sweeter, less sharp, more harmonize, and high pitch.</p>

<p>Orchestra:</p>
<p>The meaning of orchestra was in Greek definition is the semicircular area by using chorus presentation. It started in the early 1600s when an Italian opera composer, Claudio Monteverdi assigned the group of instruments which one of them will play in Opera performing. Years later, they separated different orchestra groups to symbolize, quantity and leveling the performance, chamber orchestra and symphony orchestra. Chamber orchestra started in the late 1700s by Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven when they performed in the small number of players, sometimes only 5-25 amount instrument players. In the symphony orchestra became the first group of orchestras in the early 17th century before the chamber orchestra came in, it is meant many players with mixed groups of instruments, such as woodwinds, brass, keyboards, strings, and percussions. Usually, there are over 100 symphony orchestra to play in any music genre.</p>

<p>Then in the late 1800s, some of the musicians have directed conductors, though at an early age there weren’t conductors as long there were master musicians to teach the musicians to play.</p>

<p>When the orchestra started in the early 17th century, Italy was influenced to play in opera, then a couple of years later, Germany followed them to play also in opera. Every musician's conductor, such as Johann Sebastian Bach, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Antonio Vivaldi, and Frédéric Chopin played different sounds of the orchestra and they have organized different group of orchestra what they have believed that this song can lead to playing in classical and opera music either symphonic or chamber orchestra.</p>

<p>Percussion:</p>
<p>Percussion is the oldest and unique of the instrument in historic, the first percussion drum was created originally in Turkey. Each percussion instrument represented the meaning and many people have believed that the goddesses and gods have created the drums to symbolize their religion, beliefs, and their cultures. Additionally, most drums don’t have the same musical sounds, each one of them has their rhythms and style where it leads to define the meaning while playing the drums.</p>

<p>For instance, Mesopotamia was the oldest and founded in Catal Hayak in 5600 B.C. Moreover, the people believed that the goddess Inanna created the drum and named by priestess Lipushiau of Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>Every country have transferred to another country to recreate new percussions and new characterize of their traditional cultures like Turkey created first their percussion, then when Egypt met Turkish Percussion, they created their new percussions to make their new traditions, later China, Gongs, Greece, Roman, Southeast Asia, and so on.</p>

<p>In Egypt, they created a sistrum, a small percussion instrument with jingles to shake by back and forth. This percussion instrument was created in 1186 B.C. As Mesopotamia meaning, the sistrum was by opening the heart to the goddess of music, Hathor.</p>

<p>In China, a gong is also part of the percussion instrument and very legendary of China in 6 B.C. It sounds like a thunderstorm and strong wind after hitting the Gong. Usually, it sounds silent and most often it sounds heavy to hear from long distances.<p>
<p>Marimbas was the first created percussion instrument in Africa in the 16th century. Marimbas is big and has resonators to simplify the sound of rhythm. Xylophone, where it originated from Southern Asia in the 9th Century, is not similar to Marimbas because it didn’t have the resonators and it has the different sound of rhythm that doesn’t combine with the Marimbas.</p>

<p>There are several types of Percussion instruments form around the world, each one of them has the qualities of their rhythm, their cultures, their religion, and purposes. Sometimes, some of the percussions are identified as the same instruments of percussions, such as Marimbas and Xylophone, but in reality, they are not. Most of them have their sounds and their creativity where people create different vibrations of music.</p>

Strings:

<p>Woodwinds:</p>
<p>Since percussion and keyboard started to evolve to rebuild and began more playable instruments, the same as woodwind instruments. From the past thousands of years during cavemen generation, the archeologists have found the first woodwind instrument, and it is the flute that is made of cave bear bone. Though, many music historic people believed that the first flute established in Western Europe by the end of the 2nd century.</p>

<p>After centuries, the woodwind created two groups by knowing which of the woodwind instrument belong to and meaning. The two groups of woodwind instruments are flutes and reeds or known as reed pipes. The difference between flutes and reed instruments is that flutes instruments use open-air while changing different columns, then close air to vibrate and produce the sound. The reed instruments have single-reed and double-reed; single-reed uses the single opening of a mouthpiece by vibrating when it is blown, and the same thing as double-reed, but uses two cuts to bound together while vibrating when is blown.</p>

<p>For instance, Clarinets are part of the reed instruments, with single and double-reed, and it is made in the 1600s by German instrument inventor and initial designer, Johann Christoph Denner and his son, Jacob Denner. Clarinet makes different sounds from the flute to put less vibration and putting different volumes with a high note and low note. In the 20th century, clarinet became important for jazz in music genre in the United States because in jazz they needed more rhythm almost all woodwind and string instruments, and clarinet helps them to keep in well music notes with fewer vibrations and capacities.</p>

<p>Some of the woodwind instruments might not all related to the different musical instruments, especially to brass instruments. It is sometimes confusing which of the instrument belongs to, for example, one of the instruments was hard to choose to belong between brass and woodwind instrument, saxophones. Saxophones became the most unique instrument in woodwind for every music genre, notably in jazz. It was invented by Belgian music inventor, Adolphe Sax in the 1840s, and introduced first from French military band in 1845. At first, Saxophone was going to become a brass instrument, but since it made clear that it was designed in the single-reed instrument to generate the sound.</p>

<p>Every woodwind instrument has its groups for different vibrations, sounds of quality, and rhythm. Sometimes from the past decades, it is difficult to choose which of the groups belong to, but as long as the woodwind instrument has observed clearly and listen carefully.</p>
