<p>Percussion is the oldest and unique of the instrument in historic, the first percussion drum was created originally in Turkey. Each percussion instrument represented the meaning and many people have believed that the goddesses and gods have created the drums to symbolize their religion, beliefs, and their cultures. Additionally, most drums don’t have the same musical sounds, each one of them has their rhythms and style where it leads to define the meaning while playing the drums.</p>

<p>For instance, Mesopotamia was the oldest and founded in Catal Hayak in 5600 B.C. Moreover, the people believed that the goddess Inanna created the drum and named by priestess Lipushiau of Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>Every country have transferred to another country to recreate new percussions and new characterize of their traditional cultures like Turkey created first their percussion, then when Egypt met Turkish Percussion, they created their new percussions to make their new traditions, later China, Gongs, Greece, Roman, Southeast Asia, and so on.</p>

<p>In Egypt, they created a sistrum, a small percussion instrument with jingles to shake by back and forth. This percussion instrument was created in 1186 B.C. As Mesopotamia meaning, the sistrum was by opening the heart to the goddess of music, Hathor.</p>

<p>In China, a gong is also part of the percussion instrument and very legendary of China in 6 B.C. It sounds like a thunderstorm and strong wind after hitting the Gong. Usually, it sounds silent and most often it sounds heavy to hear from long distances.<p>
<p>Marimbas was the first created percussion instrument in Africa in the 16th century. Marimbas is big and has resonators to simplify the sound of rhythm. Xylophone, where it originated from Southern Asia in the 9th Century, is not similar to Marimbas because it didn’t have the resonators and it has the different sound of rhythm that doesn’t combine with the Marimbas.</p>
